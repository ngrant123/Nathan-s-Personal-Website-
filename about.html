		About <span style= color:#ff0000>Nathan Grant </span>
		
		Nathan's <span style= color:#7FFF00;font-family:Expo Sans Pro> Artwork</span>
		-->
		
		I am a college student who was born and raised in Queens. After earning my high school diploma 
		at The Kew Forest School, I went on to attend Stony Brook University where I am currently working on a degree in <span style=color:red>Mathematics</span> 
		and a minor in <span style=color:red;border:2px>Computer Science</span>.  The reason why I am so
		interested in mathematics is because my father is a Math teacher at WhiteStone Academy in Queens and my mother is an
		Accounting Manager at The Rogosin Institute. Both of them deal with numbers and equations everyday and it has always interested me.
		On the other hand,I first experienced computer science while I was in my freshman year at Stony Brook and I immediately fell 
		in love with it. Later in my life I hope to either have a career in computer science or start my own business.		
	    During my spare time I like to paint any interesting photos that I come across on the internet. Many of the paintings that
		I have done are located in the <span style=color:blue><a href="index.html">Artworks</a> </span>section of this website. Additionally, I also like to work on any side projects that
		I would have for either mathematics or computer science. Lastly, I like to hang out with my friends and play soccer with them.
