 My name is Nathan Grant and I am a student at Stony brook University. My major is Mathematics and I am interested in doing a minor in computer science. I am also an avid soccer fan who enjoys painting.       
<br> 
My top three strengths are possessing experience in computer programming, having an analytical and artistic mind, and I am able to work effectively under time constraints and pressure.

<span style="color:red;font-weight:900">EXPERIENCE</span>
<br>
<br>
-	Made a website that showcases my artistic skills. The website was coded in HTML and CSS
<br>
website name: http://nathansartworks.com/
<br>
-	During a Hackathon, I made a website that acted as a quiz. The quiz was about artists and art history throughout the years. 
If the user entered an incorrect value, a box would be displayed on the screen, and the correct answer would be shown.
<br>
The website can be accessed through http://nathansartworks.com/ at the title screen
<br>
-	Created a Github where I uploaded practice problems that I did while I was studying java for the first time.

<br>
-	Created a functioning clock that also served as an alarm clock
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	-coded the alarm clock so that it would display the seconds on it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	-coded the alarm clock myself so that it produces a noise when the user sets the alarm time
<br>
<br>
-	Made a program that stimulated Wheel of Fortune. The program allowed the user to spin a random value. If the value was negative, the users turn would be skipped, and the computer would now randomly spin, and get a value. If either the computer or the user spun a positive value, the user, or computer, would pick a letter. If the letter that was picked was in the phrase, then the value would be added to the respective players total count. The game ends when either the computer or user, guesses all the problems.
