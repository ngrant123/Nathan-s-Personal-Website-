Personal Website

Made a website that showcases my artistic skills and tells the viewer a little bit about me. The website is 
coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, all of which I have learned by myself in the past. The whole thing was my 
summer side project and it took me about two months to write the code for and find all of the images. The purpose
of me putting the code here is for if for whatever reason the website goes down,  this is proof that I actually 
did it and that I'm not fabricating stuff on my resume.
